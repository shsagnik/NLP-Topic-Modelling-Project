## The Task

Summarize the main topics presented in the articles into the most relevant topic groups with text and visuals. This can be done using NLP tools especially Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and can provide insight into the relevant content within the articles without having to read through all of them.

## The Data

The Data is pretty straightforward and consists of text files within the `challenge2-articles` folder. Each text file will follow the format `challenge2-articleXXX.txt` where X is a number. There should be 144 total articles to summarize.
